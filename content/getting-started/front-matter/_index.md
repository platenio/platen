Platen has a built-in integration with [Front Matter][01], a VS Code extension that enhances your experience writing
and editing Markdown content.

If you followed the [happy path][02], your Platen site's already setup to use Front Matter. The tutorials in this
section walk you through Platen's Front Matter integration in a [GitHub Codespace][03], but the same functionality
applies in your local VS Code too.
