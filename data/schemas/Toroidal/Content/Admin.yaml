        the Toroidal module won't process the page correctly. A webring without an administration

        Uses Hugo's [output formats] to ensure that the Toroidal module can display the
        administration page for members to get their HTML snippets from and the JSON for the
        webring's main list is created. Without the JSON, members have no way of getting updated
        member definitions and the random link functionality won't work.

      details: |
        This setting defines the partial to use for the "About Member Administration" `details`
        element in a webring's administration page. It inherits the site's
        [sref:`Toroidal.AdminDetails`] setting. You can set it to `none` to intentionally exclude
        the details.

        The pre-defined options are:

        - `default` - Defined in `layouts/partials/toroidal/adminDetails/default.md`
        - `none` - Defined in `layouts/partials/toroidal/adminDetails/none.md`
        - `platen` - Defined in `layouts/partials/toroidal/adminDetails/platen.md`

        On Platen sites, when the `default` details would be used, `platen` is used instead to
        account for the differences between a Toroidal webring on a Platen site.
        
        #### Defining and Overriding Details

        You can override the pre-defined options by creating a file of the same name and path in
        your own site or module. You can also define entirely new options, as long as your partial
        is valid.

        The partial must return valid HTML or an empty string. If it returns an empty string, the
        details element isn't rendered.

        The partial gets the page context for the webring administration page as input.

        By default, this partial assumes that the specified details partial is a markdown file
        unless the name ends with a file extension. It also assumes that the partial is in
        `layouts/partials/toroidal/adminDetails` unless it has a path prefix, like
        `myWebring/details`.

        For example, consider the following mapping:

        - `default => toroidal/adminDetails/default.md` on non-Platen sites
        - `default => toroidal/adminDetails/platen.md` on Platen sites
        - `none    => toroidal/adminDetails/none.md`
        - `myWebring/details => myWebring/details.md`
        - `notMarkdown.thml` => toroidal/adminDetails/notMarkdown.html`

        If the partial file name has the `.md` or `.markdown` extension, the partial renders the
        Markdown to HTML.
