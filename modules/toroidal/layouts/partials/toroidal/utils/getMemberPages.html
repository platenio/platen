{{/*
  This partial expects to receive the context for a page whose type is toroidal
  and discovers all of the member sites in the same webring, returning their
  contexts in a slice.

  It does so by:
  
  1. Checking the page's parent for all the regular (i.e. non-section) pages
     which have configured their homepage to a non-empty string; any page
     without this set properly must be ignored so links don't break.
  2. Looping over those discovered pages, appending their context to the slice.
  3. Returning the slice.
